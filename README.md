# 🚗 Sensor Fusion Engineer Nanodegree – Project Repository
This repository contains my solutions, insights, and debugging notes for the [Udacity Sensor Fusion Engineer Nanodegree (ND313)](https://www.udacity.com/enrollment/nd313). It serves as a structured archive of my work across all major projects, with a focus on clean code, sensor integration, and performance optimization.
## 📁 Structure
Each project folder includes:
- `src/`: Source code and implementation files  
- `notes.md`: Debugging hints, setup instructions, and concept explanations  
- `docs/` or `results/`: Visual outputs, calibration data, or performance logs  
## 🧠 Topics Covered
- Lidar-based obstacle detection  
- Camera calibration and fusion  
- Radar signal processing  
- Kalman Filters (EKF, UKF)  
- Multi-sensor object tracking  
- ROS integration and simulation environments  
## 🛠 Technologies
- C++ (Eigen, OpenCV)  
- Python (NumPy, Matplotlib)  
- Udacity simulator  
- Sensor data formats: PCD, image frames, radar points  
## 🚀 Getting Started
1. Clone the repository  
2. Navigate to a project folder  
3. Follow setup instructions in `notes.md`  
4. Run simulations and review results  
5. Use provided hints to troubleshoot and optimize
